Code and Coffee, or vice-versa ^^

**Current Projects**  
[IdeallySpeaking- Private Repo](https://github.com/PCPrincess/IdeallySpeaking0.2)  
[RepresentApp - Private Repo](https://github.com/PCPrincess/RepresentativeApp)

Unfortunately, the Repositories for the above projects are currently private. However, once [IdeallySpeaking.net](http://ideallyspeaking.net) is closer to 'Alpha', I will deploy and the site will be viewable. Gotta save those pennies for now. Very soon, I will need to participate in some internet-panhandling to help fund the production of the project. The government will only play nice for so long before they want their student loan money back ^^.

To-Do
* Test Article addition
* Make code changes based on above testing
* Continue to refine `comment entry box`
